# Weather analysies â€” Power BI Weather Dashboard

##  Overview
Weather Report1 is a **Power BI** solution that connects to a live weather API, processes raw JSON data, and delivers an interactive dashboard for **current conditions**, **hourly forecasts**, and **daily forecasts**.  
The project showcases **ETL with Power Query (M)**, **data modeling**, and **DAX measures** to produce actionable insights for multiple cities.

##  Features
- **Live Weather Data** â€” Current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition cards for each city.
- **Forecast Analysis** â€” Hourly and daily trends with averages, highs, and lows.
- **City Comparisons** â€” Map and ranking visuals to compare weather patterns across locations.
- **KPIs & Metrics** â€” Rolling averages, % rainy days, precipitation totals, and more.
- **Reusable Data Model** â€” Dimension tables for City and Date ensure consistent filtering and relationships.

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack
- **Power BI Desktop** â€” Report creation & modeling (`.pbix` file)
- **Power Query (M)** â€” API integration & transformation logic
- **DAX** â€” Measures, calculated columns, and time intelligence
- **Git & GitHub** â€” Version control & documentation
- *(Optional)* **Python** â€” For extended preprocessing or custom CSV extracts

##  Data Flow
1. **Extract** â€” API calls for a configurable list of cities (parameterized in Power Query).
2. **Transform** â€” JSON parsing into:
   - `Current`
   - `Forecast_Hour`
   - `Forecast_Day`
   Clean column names, set data types, create keys.
3. **Load** â€” Tables loaded into Power BI model with City and Date dimensions.
4. **Visualize** â€” Dashboards with slicers, trend lines, KPIs, and comparative views.

##  Example DAX Measures
```DAX
Avg Temperature = AVERAGE(Forecast_Day[avgtemp_c])

Rainy Days % = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Forecast_Day, Forecast_Day[Condition] = "Rain")),
    COUNTROWS(Forecast_Day)
)

Max Temp = MAX(Forecast_Day[maxtemp_c])
